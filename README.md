# 📐 SmartVision: Precision Object Measurement  

**SmartVision** is a computer vision project that transforms your camera into a precision measurement tool. Using advanced contour detection and perspective correction, SmartVision calculates object dimensions with incredible accuracy, whether from an image or a live webcam feed.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Smart Object Detection**: Automatically identifies and isolates objects in any scene.  
- **Precision Measurement**: Accurately calculates object dimensions in real-world units.  
- **Versatile Input**: Supports both static images and real-time webcam streams.  
- **Visual Feedback**: Annotates dimensions directly on the objects in the image.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **OpenCV**: Industry-standard library for image processing.  
- **NumPy**: High-performance mathematical operations.  
- **Python**: Robust scripting language for development.
